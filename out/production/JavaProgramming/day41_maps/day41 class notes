Package name: day41_maps


Array vs Collection: both supports non primitives

		Array: Size is fixed
			   Supports both primitives & non-primitives
			   Can be mult-dimensional

			   Faster than Collection


		Collection: Size is dynamic
					Supports non-primitives ONLY
					Can not be multi-dimensional

					Ready methods


Map (I): Collection of Pairs (key & value)
		 Supports non-primitives ONLY
		 Size is dynamic
		 Key MUST be unique, value can be duplicated


		1. HashMap (C): Random order
						Both key and value can be null


		2. LinkedHashMap (C): Insertion order
							  Both key and value can be null


		3. TreeMap (C): Sorted order
						Key can not be null, value can be null


		4. HashTable (C): Random order
						  Both key and value can NOT be null
						  Synchronized




Methods of Map:
        put(): inserts the key and value as a pair to the map
        can also be used for updating the values of existing keys

        get(): returns the value of the given key from the map

        size() returns total number of pairs

        replace(key, new value): replaces the value of the given key

        remove(key): removes the given key, and it's value from the map

        containsValue(value): checks if the value is contained in the map, return boolean

        containsKey(key): checks if the given key  is contained in the map, returns boolean

        isEmpty(): checks if the map is empty

        equals(MapObject): checks if the map is equal to the given map in the argument, returns boolean

        clear(): removes all keys and values from the map, size will be set to 0
