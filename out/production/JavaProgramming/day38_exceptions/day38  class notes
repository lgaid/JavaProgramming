Exceptions: unwanted /unexpected events
Unchecked exceptions: occurs during the runtime
                All runtimeExceptions  are unchecked

Checked exceptions: occurs during the compile time, mut be handled right away
                All the Non RuntimeExceptions are checked
known


Error vs Exceptions: Both are throwable, both can crash our program

		Exceptions: can occur during the compile time and runtime
					Occurs due to the issues within the program itself
					Recoverable, can be handled


		Error: Occurs during the runtime
			   Occurs due to the lack/limit of the system resources
			   Irrecoverable, not recommended to handle


Exception handlings:

		1. try & catch blocks: used for handling any checked & unchecked exception

					try{
						exception codes
					}catch(ExceptionClass e){
						e.printStackTrace();
					}


				multiple catch blocks: parent exception type can never be placed before child exception type

				finally block: always get executed regardless of the exception is handled or not handled

								System.exit(1)


2. throws keyword: used for handling checked exceptions ONLY

                           (Use in the method signature)
						caller of the method will be responsible for handling the exception



throw: used for manually throwing exception

		syntax:
			throw exceptionObject  (do not use in the method signature)

Custom Exception:
	1. how to create custom unchecked exception?
			by inheriting from RuntimeException class

	2. how to create custom checked exception?
			by inherting from Exception class
